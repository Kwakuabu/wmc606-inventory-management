        ## 📈 Performance Analysis
        All implemented data structures and algorithms meet their theoretical complexity requirements:
        - Stack operations consistently achieve O(1) performance
        - Queue operations maintain O(1) efficiency with circular buffer
        - List operations provide expected O(n) search and O(n log n) sort performance
        - HashMap operations achieve O(1) average case performance
        
        ## 🎓 Project Conclusion
        This WMC 606 project successfully demonstrates mastery of data structures and algorithm analysis through a practical inventory management system. The implementation showcases professional software development practices while maintaining academic rigor in algorithm analysis and performance verification.

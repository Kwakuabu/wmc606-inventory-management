        ## 📊 Project Overview
        **Course:** Data Structures and Complexities of Algorithms  
        **Build:** #${{ github.run_number }}  
        **Commit:** ${{ github.sha }}  
        **Date:** $(date)
        
        ## 🏗️ Data Structures Implemented
        
        ### 📚 Stack (LIFO) - Categories 1-4
        - **Time Complexity:** Push/Pop/Peek = O(1)
        - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
        - **Categories:** Beverages, Bread/Bakery, Canned/Jarred Goods, Dairy
        - **Use Case:** Products added/removed from top (newest first)
        
        ### 🚶 Queue (FIFO) - Categories 5-7
        - **Time Complexity:** Enqueue/Dequeue/Front = O(1)
        - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
        - **Categories:** Dry/Baking Goods, Frozen Foods, Meat
        - **Use Case:** Products added at rear, removed from front (oldest first)
        
        ### 📋 List (Dynamic) - Categories 8-11
        - **Time Complexity:** Add = O(1), Remove = O(n), Search = O(n)
        - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
        - **Categories:** Produce, Cleaners, Paper Goods, Personal Care
        - **Use Case:** Flexible operations with search and sort capabilities
        
        ### 🗺️ HashMap (Vendor Management)
        - **Time Complexity:** Get/Put/Remove = O(1) average
        - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
        - **Use Case:** Vendor information storage and sales tracking
        
        ## ⚡ Algorithms Implemented
        
        ### 🔍 Search Algorithms
        - **Linear Search:** O(n) - Used for categories 6-11
        - **Binary Search:** O(log n) - Available for sorted data
        
        ### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms
        - **QuickSort:** O(n log n) average case - Used for alphabetical sorting
        - **MergeSort:** O(n log n) guaranteed - Alternative implementation
        
        ## ✅ Quality Assurance
        - **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test suite
        - **Integration Tests:** Database and API testing
        - **Performance Tests:** Algorithm complexity verification
        - **Code Coverage:** Detailed coverage reports
        - **Security Scan:** Dependency vulnerability analysis
